        <p> My name is Michael Jens Schlueter and my life's goal is to never stop learning. I was born and raised in Northern California. Academically my life has been all over the place. I have pursued many differnt professions throughout my scholastic career. The things I am most passionate about are saving the environment and the Los Angeles Rams football team. With a career in computer programming I would like to work for a company that is making positive strides to save the earth and leave this world better than we found it.</p>
